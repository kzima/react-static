# Create React App Snapshot

A combination of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and [React Snapshot](https://github.com/geelen/react-snapshot)

Visit the live site here: [create-react-app-snapshot.surge.sh](https://create-react-app-snapshot.surge.sh)

See what it takes to convert one to the other by looking at this [diff](https://github.com/geelen/create-react-app-snapshot/compare/303f774...master)

### Try it out

```
npm install
npm run publish -- YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE.surge.sh
```

That's it!
